    ">## Background\n",
    "A fictional productivity software company that is looking for ways to increase the number of people who pay for their software. The way that the software is currently set up, **users can download and use the software free of charge, for a 7-day trial. After the end of the trial, users are required to pay for a license to continue using the software.**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>One idea that the company wants to try is to **change the layout of the homepage** to emphasize more prominently and higher up on the page that there is a 7-day trial available for the company's software. The current fear is that some potential users are missing out on using the software because of a lack of awareness of the trial period. If more people download the software and use it in the trial period, the hope is that this entices more people to make a purchase after seeing what the software can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Metrics we want to increase for this AB_Testing:\n",
    "* Download rate (How many percentage of the users download the software for a 7-day trial\n",
    "* Purchase rate (How many percentage of the users purchase the license)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Desired result:\n",
    "* result1: Download rate increases from 0.16 to 0.175\n",
    "* result2: Purchase rate increases from 0.02 to 0.023\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Experiment Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "**We want to detect the 2 results at an overall 5% Type I error rate and at 80% power**\n",
    "<br>**Assumption: On average there are 3250 unique visitors every day**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are optimizing 2 metrics, each with ideally 5% significance leve. Measuring 2 metrics at the same time will increase the probability of type 1 error."

    "One inference we might like to make is that the new homepage attracted new users who would not normally try out the program, but that these new users didn't convert to purchases at the same rate as the existing user base. This is a nice story to tell, but we can't actually say that with the data as given. In order to make this inference, we would need more detailed information about individual visitors that isn't available. However, if the software did have the capability of reporting usage statistics, that might be a way of seeing if certain profiles are more likely to purchase a license. This might then open additional ideas for improving revenue."
